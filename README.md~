# space_image_slider

This is an image slider I wrote which was inspired by theodinproject.

This app includes a loop function which it will loop the current 4 images loaded with it. Also, the loop will pause when the user click on the "next" or "previous" buttons or simply hover mouse to the image itself.

I hope to improve myself and will be able to create an web app where user could upload their photos and this app will serve as an online image viewer.
